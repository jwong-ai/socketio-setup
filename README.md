```bash
# Build app for production use
npm run build

# Locally run the built app
npm run startbuild
# Please note that the start command is different because we only want to upload the build directory

# Run app for development with auto-reloading enabled
npm run dev

# The production command that runs node index.js from inside the build folder
npm start
```
